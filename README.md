# NumberConverter
Converts variety of numbers into different representations in Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal

This program is a calculator that I created in Java to help quickly convert numbers between Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal.
It features a userinput and calculations class to handle the conversion process with better organization.
The main code simply hosts the menu system for better organization, calling the right calculation when necessary.
