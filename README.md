# NumberConverter
Converts variety of numbers into different representations in Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal

This program is a calculator that I created in Java to help quickly convert numbers between Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal.
It features a userinput class that gets a string from the user and a string validity checker before passing it on.
It also contains a calculation class that holds all the converting processes when called.
Finally the main code simply hosts the menu system for better organization, calling the right calculation when necessary.
